# NovaCorp
Video Game + Interactive Fiction + Digital Novel = NovaCorp (ENGL 502 Final Project)

## Synopsis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if you did not have to wonder what to eat for dinner tonight? What if you never had to choose what to listen to or what to watch ever again? What if you could experience again all of your memories? What if you could get updated to the cloud after your death? What if you could visit your deceased loved ones during your dreams? What if there was something that could make your life so much easier, like an app? But what if this app was implanted directly into your brain?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Nova Corp. all of that is now possible. With the A.B.L.E. implant, the Assistant for Better Living Experience, you are connected to the internet every second of your life. Every morning the artificial intelligence calculate what food you need, what clothes you should wear and your plans for the day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally is a bright sixteen years old chosen by the A.B.L.E. implant to work for Nova Corp once she turns eighteen. Her father is one of the person in charge of making sure that the cloud dreaming experience — DreamCast®— runs smoothly. But when she is not at school, she uses the knowledge of her father to create customs dreams for people on the black market who do not want to spend their dreams with dead people. It was working great, helping a lot money-wise, until she got hacked.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While trying out one of her custom dreams for herself, she discovered a breach in Nova Corp programming. Rapidly she realized that her implant could not be trusted, even for the smallest things, and found that someone was spying on her by having infected her implant and computer. While trying to get rid of this hacker, Sally will quickly realize that he or she is in fact trying to help her find out more about this Nova Corp breach she found. Together they will have to try to uncover what is the real purpose of the implant, what is the goal of the company but also how closely the government is intertwined with Nova Corp.

## Motivation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to explore the adolescent view of the real versus the virtual because nowadays the virtual, with social media and other platforms, has taken a big part in the life of adolescents. I think that by using science fiction to explore a world where technology is running society it can be a really good way to get young adults to understand that while sometimes technology can be harming and be taken too far, it can also be used as a tool to defend yourself against an abusing authority. I also want to explore the rebellion of teenagers against a major authority figure like the government because it is often thought that adolescents are not supposed to be leaders especially in terms of rebellion against the government, expect when it comes to young adult dystopian literature. It is important to me to tell that story by the way of an interactive novel, through a digital media because I believe that adolescents who do not like to read can be introduced to more literature by presenting to them something that looked more like a video game than a book. I also believe that traditional literature should not be kept classic and that there is not a better target audience for this new type of story-telling than the adolescents who are themselves so fluent in new media. I think it can be a great way to get more young adult interested into reading but this new type of media can also bring adolescent who already like reading to a new way of discovering stories.
