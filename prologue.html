        <p>Ever since the Life Placement Test™, my implant has been malfunctioning. I think they might be a conflict between the official NovaCorp™ issued version of ABLE™ and my own custom one. </p>
          <p class="links"><a href="#">></a></p>
        <p class="hidden">Now, my memory files are getting encrypted. I can’t even rewatch days and when I can after trying to restore the files, things don’t make sense. Minor details change, like the color of my shirt or what I ate for breakfast. And significant chunks of time appear to just be … missing.</p>
          <p class="links hidden"><a href="#">></a></p>
        <p class="hidden">I am thinking about writing down everything that happens, just so I won’t lose my mind.</p>

      <div class="part2 hidden">
          <p>There are not many reasons that could explain why my memories are getting corrupted. 
            </p>
            <p class="links"><a href="#">></a></p>
          <p class="hidden">1. I made a mistake when updating it before the Life Placement Test™. Which is highly unlikely.</p>
            <p class="links hidden"><a href="#">></a></p>
          <p class="hidden">2. The test messed it up. When performing a background check, the algorithm pairs existing memory with the crime coefficient of the individual. Since mine are hacked, it still returned the right result but it might have damaged my implant. If that’s true, it will take a while to correct. This is the most likely explanation.</p>
              <p class="links hidden"><a href="#">></a></p>
          <p class="hidden">3. Someone hacked into my implant during the test. I don’t know why someone would do that, but it would explain a lot. And be incredibly creepy and could cause some huge problems.</p>
              <p class="links hidden"><a href="#">></a></p>
          <p class="hidden">At least I got placed in the Crime Management Unit™. Which, I admit, is pretty ironic. Without any alterations, my crime coefficient would definitely fall in the Latent Criminal category. But who better to catch bad guys that someone who knows how to bend the rules without getting caught…</p>
